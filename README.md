## 1. Project Overview

Freelance software development and gig marketplaces frequently suffer from two symmetrical trust failure modes:
1. **Client Default**: Freelancers invest time and technical effort with no guarantee of timely payment or fair review.
2. **Deliverable Non-Performance**: Clients deposit funds upfront with no verifiable proof of code quality, adherence to requirements, or deliverable authenticity.

Traditional gig platforms rely on centralized, opaque dispute mechanisms that judge work subjectively without cryptographic verification.

This platform resolves this dilemma through a **Milestone-Based Escrow and Evidence-Based Dispute Resolution Workflow**:
- **Milestone-Based Escrow**: Contracts are partitioned into sequential, funded milestones. Client deposits are locked in a simulated double-entry ledger before work begins. Funds are released atomically per milestone only upon explicit client approval or upon expiration of an automated 7-calendar-day review window (`REVIEW_TIMEOUT`), preventing developer payment starvation.
- **Evidence-Based Dispute Resolution**: When deliverables are contested, both parties submit cryptographic evidence (SHA-256 deliverable checksums, technical specifications, and communication logs). An in-memory Merkle Evidence Tree links all artifacts, enabling independent human dispute reviewers to inspect tamper-evident proof and issue binding rulings (full release, refund, or split settlement).
- **Deterministic Heuristic Proposal Matching (FR-11)**: Freelancer proposals are ranked against client project requirements using a multi-attribute heuristic algorithm evaluating skill tag overlap (Jaccard similarity, 50% weight), budget alignment (30% weight), and developer reputation scores (20% weight) per ADR-010.

---

## 2. Key Features

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Dedicated server-enforced interfaces for Clients, Freelancers, Dispute Reviewers, and Administrators (FR-07, FR-08, NFR-02).
- **Project & Service Marketplace**: Clients post custom projects with skill tags; freelancers publish tiered service gigs (`Basic`, `Standard`, `Premium`).
- **Proposal Bidding & Heuristic Matching (FR-11)**: Objective proposal ranking powered by deterministic multi-attribute scoring (Jaccard skill overlap, budget ratio fit, developer reputation score).
- **Milestone Sequencing & Contract Lifecycle (FR-02, FR-12)**: Phased milestone execution enforcing strict sequential dependencies (milestone $K+1$ cannot start until prior milestones resolve).
- **Simulated ACID Escrow Ledger (FR-01, FR-05, NFR-08)**: Double-entry accounting enforcing mathematical balance conservation: $\Delta\text{Escrow} + \Delta\text{User} = 0$.
- **Automated Watchdog Review Timeout (FR-02, D-02)**: Automated 7-calendar-day review window scheduler transitioning overdue reviews to `REVIEW_TIMEOUT` and triggering escrow release.
- **Cryptographic SHA-256 Deliverable Checksumming (FR-03, NFR-03)**: Streaming digest computation for all submitted deliverable artifacts.
- **Hierarchical Merkle Evidence Trees (FR-04)**: In-memory N-ary tree data structure enabling $O(V+E)$ traversal and immediate single-bit tampering detection.
- **Human Reviewer Arbitration (FR-09)**: Independent dispute resolution workflow supporting binding split rulings with duplicate ruling prevention.
- **Tamper-Resistant Chained Audit Logging (FR-06, NFR-09)**: Append-only audit trail where every state change and financial transfer is cryptographically linked: $\text{Hash}_n = \text{SHA256}(\text{Payload}_n + \text{Hash}_{n-1})$.
- **Client State Synchronization (FR-10)**: 5-second lightweight polling snapshot returning active contract and milestone states without full-page reloads.

## 4. System Architecture

```text
User Interface (Next.js 16 App Router, React 19, Tailwind CSS 4)
      ↓
Web & API Layer (Server Route Handlers, Zod 4 Schemas, Session RBAC)
      ↓
Application & Domain Layer (Contract Action Dispatcher, Lifecycle Coordinators)
      ↓
Four Academic Engineering Engines
├── Engine 01 (OS Engine): Escrow FSM, Watchdog Scheduler, KeyedMutex
├── Engine 02 (DSA & SE Engine): SHA-256 Hasher, EvidenceTree, Semantic Matcher
├── Engine 03 (DBMS Engine): Ledger Coordinator, Contract Manager, Audit Logger
└── Engine 04 (Web Engine): RBAC Enforcer, Session Service, State Poller
      ↓
Persistence Layer (SQLite Database in WAL Journal Mode)

Prisma 5.22 ORM (Serialized ACID Transactions, Foreign Key Constraints)
```

## 5. Core Operational Workflow

```text
Client posts project / Freelancer lists service gig
        ↓
Freelancer submits proposal with bid amount
        ↓
Deterministic semantic proposal matching (Jaccard + Budget + DevScore)
        ↓
Client accepts proposal & establishes phased contract
        ↓
Client deposits funds into escrow (Contract Status: FUNDED)
        ↓
Freelancer begins milestone work (Sequential dependency enforced)
        ↓
Deliverable submitted with SHA-256 digest & 7-day review timer starts
        ↓
Client Review Window
        ├── Approve → Escrow atomically released → Next milestone auto-activates
        ├── 7-day Timeout → Watchdog transitions to REVIEW_TIMEOUT → Auto-release
        └── Dispute Raised → Milestone marked DISPUTED → Escrow frozen
                ↓
        Dispute Arbitration:
        ├── Counter-evidence uploaded with SHA-256 checksums
        ├── Independent reviewer inspects in-memory Merkle EvidenceTree
        └── Reviewer issues binding ruling (Release / Refund / Split Settlement)
        ↓
Append-only cryptographic SHA-256 chained audit log records every event
```

---

## 7. Security Architecture

- **Server-Side RBAC Enforcement (NFR-02)**: Role permissions (`CLIENT`, `FREELANCER`, `REVIEWER`, `ADMIN`) are strictly enforced within server-side API route handlers via `RbacEnforcer`. Frontend tabs are visual routing conveniences; direct unauthorized requests return HTTP 401/403.
- **Session Token Integrity**: Session tokens utilize HMAC-SHA256 signatures verified with timing-safe comparisons (`SessionService`), preventing signature tampering and replay attacks.
- **Defensive Input Validation (NFR-04)**: All API route inputs are validated against strict Zod 4 schemas prior to database operations. Malformed payloads return standardized HTTP 400 envelopes.
- **Cross-Tenant IDOR Mitigation**: Contract, milestone, and deliverable operations enforce tenant ownership checks against database foreign keys before executing mutations.
- **Cryptographic Evidence Checksums (NFR-03)**: Deliverable code files and dispute evidence items are hashed using streaming SHA-256. Any modification to an uploaded artifact invalidates the Merkle root hash.
- **Append-Only Chained Audit Trail (NFR-09)**: Every financial movement and FSM state transition creates an audit log entry cryptographically linked to the previous entry, providing verifiable historical immutability.

### Explicit Scope Boundaries
- **Real Payment Gateways**: Excluded. Currency is purely simulated within the SQLite ledger to eliminate external financial risk.
- **Autonomous AI Arbitration**: Excluded. Algorithmic matching is restricted to proposal ranking; dispute arbitration requires independent human reviewer evaluation.
- **Native Mobile Applications**: Excluded. Responsive web interface optimized across mobile and desktop viewports.
- **Legal Court Contracts**: Excluded. The system enforces programmatic protocol invariants, not formal court contracts.
- **Unlimited Video Hosting**: Excluded. Large media files are represented by cryptographic hash digests.
- **Corporate Taxation / Accounting Systems**: Excluded from academic scope.
