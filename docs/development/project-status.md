## 2. Project State Consistency Audit

During the Stage S1 audit, contradictions between initial technology-neutral templates and the authoritative team source materials were investigated, classified, and corrected in derived documentation:

| Audit Item | Initial Inconsistency | Classification | Resolution / Source-of-Truth Baseline |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Language & Runtime** | `docs/architecture/` had `Language: UNKNOWN — NOT YET DECIDED` | **Derived documentation error** | Corrected to **TypeScript 5 on Node.js runtime** per Slide 16. |
| **Frontend Framework** | `docs/architecture/` had `Frontend: UNKNOWN — NOT YET DECIDED` | **Derived documentation error** | Corrected to **Next.js 16 (App Router), React 19, Tailwind CSS 4, Lucide Icons** per Slide 16. |
| **Backend & API Layer** | `docs/api/` had `API Protocol: UNKNOWN — NOT YET DECIDED` | **Derived documentation error** | Corrected to **Next.js Server Route Handlers with Zod 4 validation** and Core Contract Action Protocol per Slide 16 & 17. |
| **Database & Persistence** | `docs/database/` had `Database: UNKNOWN — NOT YET DECIDED` | **Derived documentation error** | Corrected to **Prisma 5.22 ORM with SQLite relational database and ACID transactions** per Slide 16 and Gate 0 Step 6. |
| **Security & Integrity** | `docs/security/` had `Auth: Specification Phase (TBD)` | **Derived documentation error** | Corrected to **Node.js Crypto (`sha256`) deliverable checksums and RBAC middleware** per Slide 16, 18 (FR-03, FR-08). |
| **ADR-001 Documentation** | `project-status.md` referenced ADR-001 without file existing | **Derived documentation error** | Authored `docs/decisions/ADR-001-technology-stack-baseline.md` formally capturing the team's stack. |
| **Real Payment Gateways** | Initial prompt contemplated potential gateways | **Confirmed source requirement** | Explicitly out-of-scope; purely simulated currency ledger to eliminate monetary risk. |
| **Autonomous AI Rulings** | Generic AI arbitration patterns | **Confirmed source requirement** | Explicitly out-of-scope; human dispute reviewers arbitrate with cryptographic evidence trees. |
| **Cloud Hosting Provider** | Vercel vs Docker cloud hosting | **Genuinely undecided** | Academic focus is local Ubuntu development environment for Gate 1–4 reviews. |
| **Client Review Expiry** | Exact timeout duration (days) | **Genuinely undecided** | Review timeout is required (FR-02, Slide 12); default duration pending team finalization (recommended: 7–14 days). |

## 4. Gate 1 Readiness Audit

Audit evaluation against the KLE Technological University Gate 1 (Stage S1) Requirements Baseline criteria:

| Gate 1 Evaluation Item | Status | Verification Evidence / Reference Document |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Software Requirements Spec (SRS)** | **READY** | Bounded, testable, and traceable across `requirements.md`, `functional-requirements.md`, and `non-functional-requirements.md`. |
| **2. Use Cases / User Stories** | **READY** | Detailed in `docs/requirements/use-cases.md` (UC-01 to UC-05) with main, alternate, and exception flows. |
| **3. Acceptance Criteria** | **READY** | Observable pass/fail criteria formulated for every requirement in `docs/requirements/functional-requirements.md`. |
| **4. Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)** | **READY** | End-to-end mapping from S0 needs to FRs, Use Cases, Owning Engines, Owners, and NFR targets in `docs/requirements/requirements.md`. |
| **5. Functional Requirements (FR)** | **READY** | FR-01 through FR-12 formally specified with owning engines and student owners in `docs/requirements/functional-requirements.md`. |
| **6. Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)** | **READY** | NFR-01 through NFR-10 specified with quantifiable KPI benchmarks in `docs/requirements/non-functional-requirements.md`. |
| **7. Scope & Boundaries** | **READY** | Clear in-scope features, 6 explicit out-of-scope items, assumptions, constraints, and R1–R8 risk register in `docs/requirements/project-scope.md`. |
| **8. Four-Engine Decomposition** | **READY** | Complete academic breakdown into E1 (OS), E2 (DSA/SE), E3 (DBMS), E4 (Web) with student ownership in `docs/requirements/team-project-overview.md`. |

**Gate 1 Status**:
```text
GATE 1 STATUS: APPROVED
Date: 2026-10-02
```

**Reason**:
Formal Gate 1 approval recorded on 2026-10-02. Stage S1 requirements baseline is frozen and approved. Team decisions D-01 and D-02 are ratified, and D-03 is deferred.

## 7. Stage S3 Implementation & Verification Outcomes
- **Functional Requirements (FR)**: 12 / 12 (**100% IMPLEMENTED & VERIFIED**)
- **Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)**: 10 / 10 (**100% IMPLEMENTED, MEASURED & VERIFIED**)
- **Use Cases (UC)**: 5 / 5 (**100% IMPLEMENTED & VERIFIED**)
- **Automated Vitest Test Suites**: 14 test suites, 75 tests passing, 0 failures
- **Resolved Gaps & Defects**:
  1. *Watchdog Semantics Correction*: Transitioned overdue deliverables to `REVIEW_TIMEOUT` rather than direct `APPROVED`, followed by automated escrow release to prevent freelancer starvation while maintaining audit accuracy.
  2. *FR-09 Dispute Workflow Hardening*: Implemented direct dispute filing (`POST /api/disputes`), counter-evidence submission (`POST /api/disputes/[id]/evidence`), in-memory Merkle tree inspection (`GET /api/disputes/[id]`), and binding reviewer rulings with duplicate ruling prevention.
  3. *FR-12 Milestone Sequencing*: Enforced sequential milestone dependency order in `startMilestoneWork`, automated sequential milestone activation in `releaseMilestoneEscrow`, and verified contract-level completion transitions.
  4. *UC-05 Marketplace Catalog*: Implemented `/api/gigs` (search, category filtering, tiered pricing) and `/api/orders` (escrow-backed order placement) with full RBAC protection.
  5. *NFR Benchmarking*: Measured NFR-01 (load), NFR-09 (100k audit logs), and NFR-10 (client polling sync) with empirical results documented in `docs/development/performance-results.md`.
  6. *End-to-End Persona Verification*: Verified real user journeys for Client, Freelancer, Reviewer, and Admin in `tests/integration/end-to-end-journeys.test.ts`.
