## 2. Problem Statement
Existing freelance platforms lack a structured milestone-based escrow mechanism, centralized evidence management, and a transparent dispute resolution workflow, resulting in unclear requirements, missed deadlines, payment uncertainty, and unresolvable client-freelancer conflicts. This project develops a web-based system that integrates milestone-based simulated escrow, verifiable evidence submission, role-based multi-tier arbitration, and complete audit history tracking to ensure safe and transparent collaboration.

## 3. Scope Boundaries
- **In-Scope**: User RBAC, project posting, proposals/bidding, phased milestone tracking, deliverable SHA-256 evidence submissions, simulated escrow lock/release/refund, human dispute arbitration.
- **Out-of-Scope**: Real banking / payment gateways (Stripe/PayPal), legal court enforcement, native mobile applications, autonomous AI arbitration without human review, unlimited video file storage, corporate taxation/accounting integrations.
- *Authoritative Reference*: `Mini_Project_Gate_0_details_FILLED.docx` Step 5.

## 4. Stakeholders & System Actors
- **Primary Stakeholders**: Client (deposits funds & reviews work), Freelancer (executes milestones & uploads deliverables), Dispute Reviewer (adjudicates conflicts using evidence), Escrow Officer (supervises state locks).
- **Secondary Stakeholders**: Project Manager, Administrator / Auditor, End Beneficiaries.
